# GestionClubsUniversitaires

My project entitled "CLUB'Y", is an application developed using IntelliJ, Scene Builder, PhpMyAdmin and JDBC which aims to manage clubs and their members through dashboards, as well as providing a mechanism for generating maps members for each club to each member. We have as main classes:
• The “club” class: this is the class that contains the characteristics of the club in the application 
• The “clubmember” class: which will contain the attributes that characterize a club member
